I'm Cheng Yu, or William for those who are native English speakers. I play multiple roles in life as follows:

- I'm a research assitant
- I'm a guitar-holic (for John Mayer)
- I'm an amatuer barista who makes latte/americano/shots for my colleagues on the same floor of our building in Academia Sinica
- I'm an amatuer photographer who shot weddings or events occasionally

### My background story



#### Childhood
I was raised in a family of three generations, all six members are loving and caring. My sister and I attended various camps and activities, including sports, art, literature, and music. These experiences helped me establish an open mind for knowledge from different fields. When getting in touch with new knowledge, unlike most parents would do, my parents never asked me to come out in front, or perform perfectly. Instead, they asked me to enjoy the atmosphere of learning amongst various groups of people with different talents. They wanted me to explore pure happiness that can be acquired whenever one get to know or learn new things. The way they educated me had brought me great flexibility in facing problems and making decisions.
  As a kid that loved nature and outdoor activities, my parents made me join a science club that do experiments or field researches in mountains on holidays. The founder of the club, a science teacher from a local high school, was always busy answering my “out of nowhere” questions. I did cool projects like making a flute out of bamboo (took from my grandparents’ garden with my uncle), remote control boat (designed and built with my dad), specimen of my pet rhinoceros beetle. In the making of these projects, I learned a lot about making plans, teamwork, and respect for life. These precious experiences also helped me learn more about my family, my clubmates, and myself.

#### Before College
From second grade to ninth grade, I joined our school’s Chinese orchestra and played erhu, an instrument that is similar to violin. I also took piano classes, flute classes, music theory, and percussion. The beautiful notes we played inspired my sense for aesthetic feeling. Every day after class, I managed to practice more in order to control the instrument with precision. For practices and classes day after day, I finally made my way as an orchestra principle of strings. Through these experiences, I learned so much about the patience one needs when given a challenging task, and the importance of resiliency when conducting a long-term plan in life, like practicing for skills. The experiences with orchestra also enlightened my curiosity for the composition of acoustic signals. I think my experiences in music help establish my passion for acoustic signal’s studies later.

#### Undergraduate
My college years were academically struggling. I was emotionally dependent on my comfort zone before entering college. I adjusted myself with more participations in student activities and achieved some important goals, which built foundation for my graduation award of extraordinary contribution. Then, I left home again for military service after graduation. I was asked to live alone in a storeroom full of gasoline and machinery without proper ventilation and thus aroused my sleep disorders. Meanwhile, my girlfriend cheated on me ruthlessly. Besides appealing for justice, I started to work out and study, trying to overturn my misery. I lost 37 kilograms in less than five months and got accepted through entrance exams by master's program in EE, National Taiwan University. Through these experiences, I cultivated my will through strict self-demands and harsh conditions. These unforgettable memories are my lifelong treasure of courage and perseverance.

#### Graduate
In my first year studying master program in Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering (GIEE) at National Taiwan University (NTU), I joined a project that incorporates NTU hospital, NTU, and MediaTek aiming for biomedical signal applications. It was the first time I got my hands on the raw data and design algorithms to retrieve information that I need. When I looked into similar algorithms from online computer science and information engineering (CSIE) societies, I was overwhelmed by the resources those people had established and the passion of sharing knowledge with people. The power of CS can lead to worldwide
changes and bring people better lives. From then on, I decided to get more opportunities to participate in more CS related projects. It was then I joined Dr. Tsao’s projects at NTU IOX center for more challenging problems. The first project that I took was to implement a computation reduction method for deep learning (DL) based speech enhancement (SE) models. It was my first work related to both DL and speech signal processing. In order to build prior knowledge for this research, I spent countless extra hours in late nights voluntarily to accelerate my growth in both skills and knowledge. This research was later on reported in NTU IOX center workshop with Intel, and got accepted in the IEEE signal processing letters. In these experiments, I examined the correlations between speech attributes and the SE model’s performances, and carried out experiments of an ensemble of DL frameworks. The experimental results are surprisingly great while remain high interpretability. I organized these experiments and published one master’s thesis and a journal paper, which got accepted in IEEE-ACM transactions on audio, speech, and language processing (TASLP).

#### Recent
After graduation, I found myself hungry for more knowledge of different topics or domains. To fulfil my hunger, I started to work at Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan (ROC) as a research assistant. After a year of assiduous research, I and my colleague published several papers in top notch conferences and journals of signal, speech and language processing. However, through communications and collaboration with research teams of post-docs and research fellows overseas, I found myself hunger for more specialized skills and knowledge. I was then decided to pursue a doctoral program in the US to fulfil my self-expectations. I hope that someday I can finally create some helpful application or technology that enhances human life especially for those who suffered from health issues.
